= Example Kotlin-based gRPC Service Gradle Project

This repository contains a simple example of a text messaging service with text message types defined in Protobuf files.

The Gradle build uses a custom, binary Gradle Plugin to compile the `.proto` files into Kotlin and then compile the generated Kotlin source into class files packaged in a JAR file.

The project is currently built with Kotlin `1.9.25` and Gradle `8.13`.
